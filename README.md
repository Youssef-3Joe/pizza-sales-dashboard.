📊 Statistical Deep-Dive
I performed an initial audit of the transactional data (50,000+ rows) to understand the underlying distribution and stability of the business.

Price Consistency: With a CV of 26.38%, the business shows high price stability. Since CV is < 30%, it confirms that most customers purchase within a similar price bracket.

Order Volatility (Kurtosis: 8.90): The high Kurtosis indicates a Leptokurtic distribution. This reveals a sharp concentration of standard orders with a "heavy tail" of occasional large bulk orders.

Outlier Impact: Outliers represent only 2.9% of total revenue. This is a positive health indicator, showing the business has a stable revenue base and is not overly dependent on "whale" accounts.

Revenue Skewness: A Strong Right-Skew (1.73) shows that while the median price is $16, the mean is being pulled higher by premium/bulk transactions.

🔗 Correlation Analysis
Unit Price (0.84) vs. Quantity (0.54): There is a significantly stronger correlation between Unit Price and Total Revenue than Quantity.

Insight: Revenue growth is driven more by product premiumization (selling higher-value pizzas) than by simply increasing the number of items per order.

📈 Operational Trends (Daily & Hourly)
The Friday Peak: Friday is the peak operational day, followed by Thursday and Saturday.

The Sunday Dip: Transaction volume hits its lowest point on Sundays and Mondays, identifying a 27% surge in demand as the week progresses toward Friday.

Bimodal Demand Pattern: Revenue is concentrated in two primary surges: Lunch (12:00 PM – 1:00 PM) and Dinner (4:00 PM – 7:00 PM).

The "Dead Zone": Minimal activity is noted in the early morning, with a strategic "operational lull" between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM—ideal for staff transitions.

🍕 Category & Product Intelligence
Market Share: Revenue is distributed evenly across categories, indicating a low-risk product portfolio.

Size Optimization: Large pizzas are the primary revenue drivers. XL and XXL sizes show negligible market penetration, suggesting an opportunity to reduce specialized inventory costs.

Volume Leader: Classic Pizzas remain the cornerstone of the menu, representing the lowest-risk path for future product expansions.

🏆 Product Power Matrix & Seasonality
The Champions: By comparing Revenue vs. Quantity, I isolated high-margin premium items from high-frequency volume drivers to balance marketing focus.

Seasonal Intensity: A significant mid-year peak in July suggests a correlation with summer holidays, allowing for better long-term procurement and labor planning.
