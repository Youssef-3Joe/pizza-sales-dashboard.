# pizza-sales-dashboard.

I’ve always believed that data has a story to tell, so I decided to listen to what a year’s worth of pizza sales had to say. I built this end-to-end Business Intelligence dashboard using Python and Streamlit to transform over 50,000 rows of raw numbers into a clear, visual strategy. From discovering our 'Friday Golden Day' to identifying the 'Dead Zone' in morning sales, this project isn't just about charts—it's about finding the pulse of a business and providing the insights needed to keep the ovens hot and the customers happy.
